# RUL_estimation_Induction_Motor
This repository contains the details of the project Remaining Useful Lifetime Estimation of Ball Bearing of Induction Motor.
Open sourced [PRONOSTIA Bearing dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/pronostia-bearing-dataset) is used to train the model. The features are extracted and selected using PCA and Fine-Gaussian SVM model is trained to predict the remaining useful lifetime of the ball bearings of the induction motor with 85.8% accuracy.
